# university-programming
##background
This project is started in Wuhan university, more precisely, School of Mathematics and Statistics  
While learning mathematics courses and doing some computer-mathematics researchs (_independently problems solving or just  homework assigned by professors_) , we may produce many worth-sharing codes by using  softwares such as Matlab and Mathematica.  
##goal
This project is aiming at better communicating our ideas in writing enjoyable codes.  
**It is welcome for you to join us!**
##initial files
There are serval files tagged by _initials_, which come from the code exited in my laptop written in the past half years.
I hope the files uploaded satisfies the goal made in preceding part.
##update plan
I will try to update these codes once a week.
##expectations
Necessary notes in your codes is welcome.    
If possible, a README file describing your sub-project is appreciated by everyone.
By the way, I will try to adds some README files in some sub-projects in the _initials_ folders mentioned above.
##others
Leave it blank at this stage.

**Thanks!**
